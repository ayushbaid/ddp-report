\chapter{Literature Survey}

The bibliographic entries are to be kept in a file named
\verb|<something>.bib|. In this sample report we call it as
\verb|mylit.bib|. This file must be included without the \verb|.bib|
extension in the main file as: \verb|\bibliography{mylit}|.   Open the
file \verb|mylit.bib| to see the format in which the entries are
written. This is written in the Bib\TeX format. Most of the
bibliographic web pages (Scopus, ISI Web) and software (EndNote, etc)
allow you to export bibliographic entries in the Bib\TeX format.
